Model Notes:

Majora's Mask 3D: "The Moon" AKA "Inside the Moon" AKA "Tree Field"
-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Files ripped and exported directly from the game's "CMB" model file.
- Many parts of the scene are positioned relatively from the origin using "bones".
- These bones have been ripped and exported in the correct relationships as the original game.
- This DAE/FBX model should also have preserved the proper Vertex Color data used in MM3D.
- This DAE/FBX model should also have preserved the proper Vertex Alpha Color data used in MM3D (though I don't believe this scene uses it... vertex alpha is mostly used for water, smoke, and magic effects)
