@page getting_started Getting Started

This page provides an introduction to setting up and compiling a project using the custom C-based game engine.

@section project_context Project Context

This game engine was developed as part of a second-year Computer Science project at the University of Le Mans. The project, Claude Chappe: The Infernal Curse of the Silent Shadows, is a first-person horror game set in the Claude Chappe computer science building. The player must navigate the eerie halls, avoiding terrifying professors while collecting hidden grades necessary to pass their degree.

The game is built in pure C, using SDL2 and OpenGL for rendering, with an architecture inspired by Godot.
