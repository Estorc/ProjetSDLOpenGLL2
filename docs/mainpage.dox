/**
 * @mainpage Claude Chappe' Curse - A C Game Documentation
 * 
 * Welcome to the documentation for **Claude Chappe' Curse - A C Game**. This project provides:
 * - A set of mathematical utilities
 * - Modular and reusable functions
 * - Well-documented APIs for integration
 * - **An approach of C class expending the C struct**
 * - **An original game engine fully operational asking only base C knowledges**
 * 
 * ## Features
 * - **Easy to Use**: Simple API for common operations
 * - **High Performance**: Optimized for speed and efficiency
 * - **C class preprocessor**: A python/C preprocessor has been developped to handle the support of class in C.
 * - **Game engine fully operational**: A game engine inspired of Godot's nodes system and really easy to use (level & code editor in developpment).
 *

 * 
 * ## Getting Started
 * To use this game engine:
 * 1. Refers to the given doc.
 * 2. Starts your game from scratch by creating your first scene using the template scene in reference.
 * 3. Have fun!
