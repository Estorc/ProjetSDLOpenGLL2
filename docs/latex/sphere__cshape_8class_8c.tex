\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file contains the implementation of the \doxylink{class_sphere_c_shape}{Sphere\+CShape} class. 

This source file provides the functionality for creating and manipulating spherical shapes within the application. It includes methods for initializing, rendering, and updating the properties of a sphere. The \doxylink{class_sphere_c_shape}{Sphere\+CShape} class is designed to be used in conjunction with the Open\+GL rendering pipeline to display 3D spherical objects.

The code in this file is intended to facilitate the creation of complex 3D scenes by providing a reusable and efficient way to handle spherical geometries.
