\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\doxylink{class_framebuffer}{Framebuffer} class implementation. 

This file contains the implementation of the framebuffer class, which is used to manage framebuffer objects in an Open\+GL context. It provides functions to create, bind, unbind, and delete framebuffer objects, as well as to attach textures and renderbuffers to them.

Detailed description\+: The framebuffer class is essential for off-\/screen rendering in Open\+GL. It allows rendering to textures and renderbuffers instead of directly to the screen. This is useful for various advanced rendering techniques such as shadow mapping, post-\/processing effects, and more. The class ensures proper management of framebuffer resources and provides a convenient interface for their usage.
