\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file defines the implementation of the capsule shape class. 

This file contains the implementation details for the capsule shape class, which is used to represent and manipulate capsule-\/shaped objects within the application. It includes functions for creating, rendering, and managing the properties of capsule shapes.

Detailed description\+: The capsule shape class provides a way to create and handle capsule-\/shaped objects in the application. It includes methods for initializing the shape, setting its dimensions, and rendering it using Open\+GL. This class is part of the nodes module and interacts with other shape classes to provide a comprehensive set of geometric shapes for the application.
