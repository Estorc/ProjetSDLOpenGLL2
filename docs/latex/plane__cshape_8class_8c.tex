\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file defines the implementation of a plane shape class. 

This source file contains the implementation details for the plane shape class, which is a part of the node-\/based structure in the project. It provides the necessary functions and data structures to create, manipulate, and render plane shapes within the application.

The plane shape class is designed to be used in conjunction with other shape classes to build complex 3D models and scenes. It includes methods for initializing the plane, setting its properties, and integrating it with the rendering pipeline.
