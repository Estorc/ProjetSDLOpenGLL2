\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This source file defines the \doxylink{classBoxCShape}{Box\+CShape} class and its associated methods. 

This source file contains the implementation of the \doxylink{classBoxCShape}{Box\+CShape} class, which is used to represent and manipulate box-\/shaped collision shapes in the application. It provides functionalities for creating, initializing, and managing box collision shapes, as well as handling their interactions within the physics engine.

The \doxylink{classBoxCShape}{Box\+CShape} class is designed to be used in conjunction with other collision shapes and physics entities to simulate realistic physical interactions in a 2D or 3D environment. It is a crucial component of the physics simulation system, enabling accurate collision detection and response for box-\/shaped objects.
