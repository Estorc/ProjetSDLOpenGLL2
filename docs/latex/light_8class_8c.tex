\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file contains the implementation of the light class for the project. 

This source file provides the functionality for managing different types of lights within the application. It includes the necessary functions to create, update, and manipulate light objects, which are essential for rendering scenes with proper lighting effects in the SDL and Open\+GL environment.

The light class is designed to handle various light properties such as position, color, intensity, and type (e.\+g., directional, point, spotlights). It ensures that the lights are correctly integrated into the rendering pipeline, allowing for realistic and dynamic lighting in the 3D scenes.

This file is a crucial part of the project as it directly impacts the visual quality and realism of the rendered scenes by providing the necessary tools to work with lighting.
