\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file defines the implementation of various \doxylink{class_c_shape}{CShape} classes. 

This source file contains the implementation of different shapes used in the project. It provides the necessary functions to create, manipulate, and render these shapes using SDL and Open\+GL. The shapes include basic geometric forms such as circles, rectangles, and polygons.

It is designed to facilitate the creation and management of shapes within the graphical application, ensuring efficient rendering and interaction.
