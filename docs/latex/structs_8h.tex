\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file contains forward declarations of all structures used in the engine. 

This file contains forward declarations of all structures used in the engine. Forward declarations are used to declare a structure without defining its members. This allows the structure to be used in other structures or functions without including its definition.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Forward declarations are useful when structures are used in multiple files, reducing the number of includes. 

Forward declarations are also useful when structures reference each other, avoiding circular dependencies.
